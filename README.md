## Project Overview

I did this project as a React refresher and to use an open sourced API. This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). This app uses [The Movie Database's open-sourced API](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction).

The app makes use of their "most popular movies" call that returns the 20 most popular movies.

Cheers
